        <h2 style="font-family: play; color:#02eefc;font-size: 25px;"> What is a cryptocurrenncy?</h2>
        <p> For you to understand better, a cryptocurrency is a digital asset that uses cryptographic encryption to guarantee its ownership and ensure the integrity of transactions, and control the creation of additional units, that is, prevent someone from making copies as we would do, for example, with a photo. These coins do not exist in physical form: they are stored in a digital wallet.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: play; color:#02eefc;font-size: 25px;"> How does a cryptocurrency work?</h3>
        <p> Cryptocurrencies have several differentiating characteristics compared to traditional systems: they are not regulated or controlled by any institution and they do not require intermediaries in transactions. A decentralized database, blockchain or shared accounting record is used to control these transactions. </p>

        <h4 style="font-family: play; color:#02eefc;font-size: 25px;"> How to make the purchase?</h4>
        <p> 
        In the products button, you will find 6 different cryptocurrencies that you can buy instantly and safely with your credit or debit card and with the best commissions on the market 24 hours a day, since, like all we know, buying with a card is the fastest and most comfortable way available. <br>
